# from bintrees import BinaryTree

# I wanted to piggyback on one of these packages to have left and right child
# and most importantly, borrow treelib.Tree's show method
# in the end, found these packages having more than what I need
# and wrote my own little class in
# C:\Users\henry\Documents\GitHub\ctci6\Chapter4\48_first_common_ancestor.py
# may come back and learn 1 of these packages' API later

# class BinaryTree(Tree):
#     def __init__(self, root, left_child, right_child):
#         pass
